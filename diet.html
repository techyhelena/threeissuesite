				<h3 class= "dSubtitle">Being an idol isn't just about how talented you are, your appearance plays a big role. And unfortunately people won't respect you unless your beauty is out of this world. Therefore idols are required to diet before their debut or comeback so they can capitivate the audience. In worse case scenarios, they undergo extreme diets or starve themselves to lose weight.</h3>
				<h3 class= "dSubtitle">The IU diet was one of the diets that went viral for losing weight. It contained of eating 1 apple for breakfast, 2 sweet potatoes for lunch, and one protein shake for dinner. One of the main reasons why it went viral was because of how dangerous this diet was. The amount of food you're consuming is not sufficient enough to support your body -- especially in an idol's heavy load schedule. </h3>
