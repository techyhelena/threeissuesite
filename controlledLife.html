				<h6 class= cSubtitle>There are occasions where the company forces idols to act a certain way or even the group as a whole just to fit their "brand image". Another reason for this is to appeal to the market so that they can attract new fans. Idols shouldn't be forced to be someone they're not just for the sake of branding. This makes kpop feel manufactured and not unique. An example of this is Jeongyeon from TWICE. She was known to be the tomboy/girl crush member in her group because JYPE (her comapny) insisted on placing this image/concept on her. She later revealed that the staff didn't let her grow out her hair to maintain the tomboy concept. Luckily now she has more freedom in her style.</h6>

				<h6 class= "cSubtitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px">Most if not all idols are restricted to do certain activites. One of the most popular one you may be familar with is the no-dating rule. And the main reason why this exists all goes back to the branding discussion; they want their idols to be "accessible" to their fanbase, creating this parasocial relationship between the idol and the fans. So when idols do get "caught in a dating scandal", they may risk losing their fanbase because there are fans that feel that idols are obligated to stay single for them. This controlling mindset is toxic to both the idol and the delusional fans. </h6>
				<h6 class= "cSubtitle" style="margin-top: 10px">Shown above is Taeyeon (SNSD) and Baekhyun (EXO). They previously dated in the year of 2014; their relationship was revealed by Dispatch, a paparrazi tabloid that is infamous for invading idol's private life. Either way, fans didn't take the new well and sent hate to the couple. Unfortunately they broke up shortly after the news had spread and even then, Baekhyun's "fans" (EXO-Ls) still continued to harass Taeyeon even though she apologized (which she shouldn't have to)</h6>
