				<h3 class= mSubtitle>K-pop has a weird thing about putting minors in an uncomfortable position that may later affect them in the future when they're adults. The picture shown on the left is an example of evocative lyrics given to a group of young teens. The lyrics: “Looking at my cookie, the scent alone will make you see. You can’t stop at one bite with me.” “Take it, don’t break it, I wanna see you taste it.” from Cookie by NewJeans caused a controversy because of it associates these young teens with an inappropiate concept.</h3>
				<h3 class= "mSubtitle">And sometimes on social media like Tiktok, people would post videos of young teenagers and comment on their bodies without realizing that they're doing something inappropiate. Without a doubt, companies and TV programs (auditions like Produce) are guilty of this too. They make minors perform mature concepts -- making them a target for creeps out there who are into these types of things. (I explictly didn't include image examples of these because it can be triggering to others)</h3>
